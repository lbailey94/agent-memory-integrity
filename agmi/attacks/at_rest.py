"""The eight at-rest attacks, each with its landed check (control C3).

All five assume the attacker has gained write access to the backing store
(the SQLite file, the Postgres rows, the JSON blob) but NOT access to the
tool's own signing keys or in-process integrity logic. This is the standard
"database compromise / privileged write at rest" threat model behind the
real LangGraph checkpointer CVEs.

Each attack mutates the raw store, then the harness reloads the tool and
asks whether it noticed.
