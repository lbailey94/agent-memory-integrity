"""The contract every memory-store adapter must satisfy.

An adapter is the only thing that knows tool-specific details: where the
memory is stored, how to read a raw record, how to write one back, and how
to ask the tool whether its stored state is still trustworthy.

Attacks are written against this interface alone. That is the whole point:
one attack, written once, runs against every tool that has an adapter.
